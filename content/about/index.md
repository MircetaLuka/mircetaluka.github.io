In the summer of 2020, I graduated from the **Akademisches Gymnasium in Innsbruck**, where I completed both the **Austrian Matura** and the **International Baccalaureate**.

The following year, I served my civilian service abroad at the **Jewish Historical Museum in Belgrade**, where I assisted in the digitization of the archives and contributed to projects promoting memorial culture in cooperation with the Austrian Embassy in Belgrade.

During my education at the Akademisches Gymnasium, I volunteered for the **Austrian Service Abroad** as a **tutor** and **regional representative**, providing support to new prospective participants and organizing monthly meetings.

I am currently pursuing my undergraduate studies in **Computer Science**, where I have gained a solid foundation in various programming languages, including **Python, C, Java, and Haskell**. My coursework has also provided me with experience in frameworks such as **SpringBoot** and **Flask**.

Additionally, I have developed skills in **Operating Systems** and **Database Systems**, working with both **SQL** and **NoSQL** databases.

In the **summer of 2024**, I had the opportunity to participate in an **exchange semester** at the **University of Novi Sad**. During this time, I developed profound skills in **Artificial Intelligence** and **Social Networks**, and gained hands-on experience with **Angular** and **Software Testing**.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I have been working **since October 2022 at Fuchs IT Consulting**, where I have gained valuable **hands-on experience** in real-world software projects. Most notably, I have had the privilege of working on projects commissioned by the Society for Musical Performing Rights (GEMA). These projects have allowed me to apply my technical skills and collaborate with a diverse team to develop software solutions that cater to the unique needs of the music industry.
